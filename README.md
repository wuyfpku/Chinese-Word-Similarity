# Chinese-Word-Similarity
Word similarity computation is a fundamental task for natural language processing. We organize a semantic campaign of Chinese word similarity measurement at NLPCC-ICCPOL 2016. This task provides a benchmark dataset of Chinese word similarity (PKU-500 dataset), including 500 word pairs with their similarity scores. There are 21 teams submitting 24 systems in this campaign.
